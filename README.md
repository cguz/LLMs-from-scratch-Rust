# Acknowledge

This idea is based on the book [*Build a Large Language Model (from Scratch)*](http://mng.bz/orYv) of Manning and the official source code repository [LLMs-from-scratch](https://github.com/rasbt/LLMs-from-scratch).

The method described in this book for training and developing your own small-but-functional model for educational purposes mirrors the approach used in creating large-scale foundational models such as those behind ChatGPT. However, whenever it is necessary we will improve it.
